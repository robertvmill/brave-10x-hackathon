Step 1: I made a context file with what i'm doing/buildnig
Step 2: I started gathring documentation on th elatest documentation and useful links
    - this is important because often the models don't have the latest most up to date information on the tools at their disposal
Step 3: I started looking at competitors and gathering all the things I like
    - Go through the app
    - take screenshots of every screen i go to

Step 4: start initial build
    - hi im participating in the brave ai hackathon. ill just give you some context on what I have to build in the about the competition section @about-the-competition.md , @useful-links.md , ive also attatch a list of useful links to documentation that we will probably use, can you help me out with it?

Step 5: use the ask method
    - rather than have the AI code, use the ask function on its plan
